# This is a skill planner for Nioh. 
Intended for endgame at this time. I will continue to develop this project if there is interest or if I find a new feature to add. Feel free to fork and credit this project for your own use.

##TODOs (in no particular order):
- collect skill names and points
- design frontend workflows
- build frontend
- test, test, test

##Feature Ideas (might be worked on after all TODOs are completed. Contact me for new features you would like to see.):
- save build to cookies or localstorage
- skill demo videos like in the game
- smarter skill unlocking (notifications of missions needed to complete prior to unlocking skill, stat requirements, etc.)
- make it pretty (bootstrap, animations, graphics, other cool shit)
- premade builds suggested by community
- backend? - if required...
