# This is a skill planner for Nioh. Intended for endgame at this time.

##TODOs (in no particular order):
- collect skill names and points
- design frontend workflows
- build frontend
- test, test, test

##Planned Features (will be worked on after all TODOs are completed):
- save build to cookie
- skill demo videos like in the game
- smarter skill unlocking (notifications of missions needed to complete prior to unlocking skill, stat requirements, etc.)
- make it pretty (bootstrap, animations, graphics, other cool shit)
- premade builds suggested by community
- backend? - if required...
